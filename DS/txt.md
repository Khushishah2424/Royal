<!-- mallox - block
calloc - same size n block
free

linked list:
when you want that time you allocate
[data|next pointer]

double
[pre|data|next pointer] -->

**To Ways to Maintian a list in memory**
1. ARRAY
2. LINKED-LIST

**LINKED-LIST**
1. Signle - forward
        NODE
    data     link(address of next pointer)
2. Double  - forward and backword
3. Circuler - last element is linked to first element

**DOUBLE LINKED LIST**
    It is Different from Single list in a way that each node has an extra pointer that points to the previous node,together with the next pointer and data similar to single list

    NULL | DATA | NEXT      PREV | DATA | NEXT  

    In this ,we got the ability to go backwards



**DATA STRUCTURES**

**Linerar**
1. Stack:
    A stack is a linera data structures that follows the lifo method that is last in first out.

    Key-operation in stack:-
    1.Push - add
    2.Pop  - remove
    3.Peek - returns the top element
    4.Isempty - check that stack is empty or not
    5.Isfull  - check if the stack is full or not

    Adavantages:-
    1.Stacks are simple and easy to understand
    2.Efficincy
    3.Limited Memory uasag

    DisAdvantage:-
    1.Limited Access - Elements in a Stack can only be accessed from top,difficult to modify elements from middle
    2.limited capacity


2.Queue:
    A Queue is a linear data structures that follows the fifo method that is first in first out.
    

    Enqueue(Insert) - add
    Dequeue(Remove) - Delete
    Peek - returns the elements at the front of the queue without removing it
    Empty - checks if the queue is empty or not
    Full - checks if the queue is full or not
