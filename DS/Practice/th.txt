Here are several questions across various difficulty levels to help you practice and master data structures, particularly focusing on arrays. These questions will help reinforce your understanding and proficiency in handling arrays in programming.

Beginner
Find the Second Largest Element: Given an array of integers, find the second largest element.
Check if an Array is Sorted: Write a program to check if an array is sorted in ascending order.
Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array: Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new length.
Intermediate
Rotate Array: Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
Move Zeroes: Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
Two Sum: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
Advanced
Merge Intervals: Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals.
Spiral Matrix: Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.
Longest Consecutive Sequence: Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest
