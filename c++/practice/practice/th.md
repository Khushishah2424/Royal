**CLASS** = class is a user define data type which contains data members and member function
- Data member : these are the variables that belongs to a class ,they can be differnt type such as int,char,float etc ,  they store the vlaue of an object of the class
-member function : member function are the function associated with particular object of class


**OBJECT** = object is an identity of a class.

**CONSTRUCTOR** = Constructor is a special fucntion that contains same name as class name without void
              Constructor can not have return
              Constructor can have arguments
              Constructor is called autometically when object is created

              *Types of Constructor:
              1.Default Constructor : A Constructor which has no arguments.
              2.Parameterized Constructor :  A Constructor which has arguments/parameters.

**DESTRUCTOR** = A destructor works opposite to constructor; it destructs the objects of classes. It can be defined only once in a class. Like constructors, it is invoked automatically.


**THIS-POINTER** = In C++ programming, this is a keyword that refers to the current instance of the class. There can be 3 main usage of this keyword in C++.

**STATIC** = In C++ programming, this is a keyword that refers to the current instance of the class.

**STRUCTS** = 'struct' is like a box where you can keep different types of things together, and you can easily access them whenever you need them. It's a simple way to organize your stuff!

**POLYMORPHISM**

1.OVERLOADING:
    If we create two or more members having the same name but different in number or type of parameter, it is known as C++ overloading. In C++, we can overload:

    Function overloading
    Operator overloading
