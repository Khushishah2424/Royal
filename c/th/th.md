**DATA STRUCTURES**

**STACK**
A stack is a linera data Structures in which insertion and deletation are allowed only at the end , is called 
top of the stack.(LIFO)
As a stack is a linear Data structures , we can implement it using and array or linked-list.

eg : Stack of books , s tack of coins

Both examples have tow things in common:
1.Any object(either book or coin)can be accessed only from the top
2.Any object can be added only at the top


Primary stack operation:
1.PUSH : (insert data onto stack)
2.POP  : (Deletes Last inserted element from the stack)

Secondary Stack Operations:
1.TOP()  : return the last inserted element without removing it.
2.SIZE() : return the size or the number of element in the stack.
3.isEmply() : return true if the stack is emply,else return false.
4.isFull() : : return true if the stack is full,else return false.
