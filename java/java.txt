Java Installation:
    1.JDK - Java Development kit
            For running java program 
    2.JRE - Java Runtime Enviorment 
            Help in executing program
    3.JVM - Java Virtual MAchine

    1.Compilation:
    Source Code - .java (save) --> Compiler (IN JDK) --> Covert into byte code(JRE) - .class(save)
    2.Execution:
    byte code --> JVM --> Native Language(computer lan - 0 and 1)


Static -  Without creating an object we can execute our class


theory:
--> Any non-Static Method can be called only with class object if we are calling from static Method , but if we
    want to call non-static method from non-static no need of object
--> Any static method can be called with class name or Without class name inside


*Instance Variable:
    Instance Variable need not to intilized compulsory
    If Instance Variable is not assigned , then it will give default value
    Can not use non-static Instance Variable in Static Method
    both Static and non-static Variable Instance Variable can be use in non-static Method
    n copy will generate for non-static Instance Variable
    Only one copy will generate for static Instance Variable


*Local Variable:
    Local Variable need to be intilized compulsory
    Can not create Static Variable inside the main Method due to Heap and Stack concepts
